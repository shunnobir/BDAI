          The BDAI sub-project addresses the urgent need for sustainable,
          meaningful, accessible, reusable, and traceable (SMART) data.
          Currently, most data across different sectors in BD is static,
          read-only, and aggregated, with challenges such as non-compliance with
          FAIR principles, semantic heterogeneity, and limited analytical
          compatibility. To resolve these issues, this project proposes an SMART
          data ecosystem powered by KGs and LLMs to enable sustainable data
          management and AI-driven insights across socio-economics, agriculture,
          healthcare, tourism, and education.

          BDAIâ€™s key activities include collecting data, developing an open data
          quality measurement framework, building an SMART data ecosystem, and
          producing FAIR-compliant sectoral KGs. Additional efforts include
          enabling cross-sector analytics, designing AI tools with natural
          language interfaces and LLMs, and conducting workshops, training
          programs, and publications to build stakeholder capacity.
